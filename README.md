# Data Analysis and Churn Prediction Using Snowflake Notebooks

## Overview

In this Quickstart, we will play the role of a data scientist at a telecom company that wants to identify users who are at high risk of churning. To accomplish this, we need to build a model that can learn how to identify such users. We will demonstrate how to use Snowflake Notebooks in conjunction with Snowflake/Snowpark to build a Random Forest Classifier to help us with this task.
